# Open Weather - Weather Forecast Application

Open Weather is a test mobile application to predict weather conditions. It was developed using Dart and Flutter with Flutter BLoC for state management and the API is from [Open Weather Map](https://api.openweathermap.org/). The architecture is a combination of Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture and BLoC which is the recommended pattern for Flutter applications.
